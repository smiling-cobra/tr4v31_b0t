"""Service singletons shared by the journal handlers.

Reach services through this module's attributes — `deps.llm_svc.extract_tags(...)`, never
`from .deps import llm_svc`. A value import binds the real service into the importing module,
where `patch('bot.handlers.journal.deps.llm_svc')` cannot reach it: the patch succeeds, the
handler keeps the real object, and the test passes while hitting a live Anthropic client.
Attribute access keeps one patch point for every handler.
