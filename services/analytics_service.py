"""Behavioural instrumentation.

The point of this layer is to answer questions the code cannot: how many people
finish onboarding, how many reminders turn into check-ins, how often the
guidance offer is accepted, what a user costs in Anthropic calls. None of that
is reconstructable later, which is why the event set below is deliberately
broader than what is being asked of it today. Expect to delete some of it.

**Two rules hold this layer in place.**

*Events never carry entry text.* The journal entry is the most sensitive thing
the bot stores; it already lives in the entries collection and goes to Anthropic,
both of which the privacy notice discloses. Copying it into a third store would
create a PII surface nobody disclosed and `/delete` would have to chase.

What actually upholds that rule is the call sites: every prop is a scalar or a
closed-vocabulary label — scores, counts, lengths, category names from
`services/safety.py`, an exception's class name. `_scrub` is a backstop beneath
them, not the guarantee itself. It drops strings long enough to be prose,
wherever they sit — a bare prop, or nested in a list or dict — which catches the
realistic mistake of passing `text=` instead of `text_length=`. It cannot catch
a three-word entry, because nothing about the length of one distinguishes it
from a label. Adding a prop means checking it by eye; the net is there for the
day someone doesn't.

*Tracking never raises.* A failed insert must not cost a user their check-in.
Every path here is wrapped and logged. This is the opposite of the crisis
lexicon's fail-closed rule, and for the opposite reason: a missing analytics row
harms nobody, while a lost check-in harms the person who wrote it.
