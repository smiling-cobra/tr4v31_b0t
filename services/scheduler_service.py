# How long after a user's reminder time the bot will still deliver. An exact
# minute match needs a tick to land inside a single 60-second slot: a deploy, a
# machine reboot, or a tick that overran drops that day's reminder entirely and
# nobody finds out. The window trades punctuality for delivery — a nudge half an
# hour late is still a useful nudge, a missing one is a broken product.
#
# Two consequences worth knowing. A reminder scheduled inside the hour that DST
# skips forward is missed for that one day, because local time never enters the
# window. And the window never crosses local midnight (see `_minutes_since_due`),
# so a late-evening reminder time is clipped at 00:00 rather than spilling onto
# the next day, where it would be recorded against the wrong date.

class SchedulerService:
    """Periodic reminder and weekly-summary delivery.

    The repeating tick only decides *who* is due. Everything it finds is handed
    to a one-shot job per user, so the global loop never waits on a Telegram
    send or — far worse — on an Anthropic call summarising someone's week. Left
    inline, one slow LLM response would delay every other user's reminder behind
    it, and a tick running past its own interval is skipped by APScheduler, so
    the delay compounds into dropped sends.

    The tick is a coroutine on the bot's event loop and so are the jobs. The
    services they call are synchronous, so every one of them is dispatched to a
    worker thread — a blocking Mongo scan or Anthropic call here would stall
    message handling for every user, not just the one being notified.

    Duplicate suppression has two layers, because the due window means a user
    stays due for ~30 ticks rather than one:

    * `_inflight` covers the gap between scheduling a job and that job writing
      its watermark. One process owns the bot (`fly scale count 1`, see
      fly.toml), so an in-memory set is enough.
    * The per-user date watermarks — `last_reminder_sent`,
      `last_weekly_summary_sent`, `last_weekly_summary_check` — survive restarts
      and close the window for the rest of the local day.

    A job that raises writes no watermark, so the next tick retries it; the due
    window is what bounds those retries.
